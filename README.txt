The Zend Framework model generator is a PHP CLI tool for generating Zend_Db_Table models 
based on table names and foreign keys. The project is still in alpha phase at the moment, 
so expect broken things.

The tool is restricted to connect to MySQL databases only. In future releases PDO will
replace this connector.

USAGE: php zfmodelgenerator.php
